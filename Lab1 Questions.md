Lab 1 Questions

How many unique users are in the data?

	31 users
 
How many salts did you create?

	931 salts
 
How many possible combinations will I need to try to figure out the secret ID of all 

students (assume I know all potential secret IDs)

	It would be something like 5^27+10. So about 5 to the 37th power.
 
Instead of salts, if you were to use a nonce (unique number for each hashed field) how many possible combinations would I need to try?

	I think the possible combinations would be almost infinite.

Given the above, if this quiz data were actual class data, say for example your final exam, how would you store this dataset? Why?

	I wouldnt hash tis data because I don’t think its important enough. If I were to store it, I would just keep it in plaintext.

What did you think about Task 2?

	Task 2 took me a lot longer to figure out but once I understood what was being asked, I thought it was simple.
 
Is there a better way than brute force to attempt to get higher valued coins?

	It’s possible that there are better ways.

Why or why not?

	Theres probably mathematical equations that have a higher chance of finding higher valued coins.
